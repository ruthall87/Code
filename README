1. Initialize your app with a package.json using an npm command
2. Create a start command in your package.json with the contents "nodemon app.js"
3. Enter the following contents into a file and start your server with "npm start". HINT: **You might need to do
   something before your app is able to run.**
4. Uncomment the line that begins with // app.use(express.someMiddleware()) and replace someMiddleware with a built-in
   middleware function from express that parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based on body-parser
5. Increment the numRequests variable inside of numRequestsMiddleware before next() is called
6. GET "/" should respond with "You visited the API numRequests times" instead of "Coding interview 3!" (make sure an
   integer is displayed for the count)
7. GET "/cars" should respond with the array of cars
8. POST "/cars" should add a car to the cars array with an id and respond with a 201 status code
9. POST "/cars" should not add cars that don't have both a "name" and a "color" property
10. GET "/cars/:id" should respond with the car of the id passed in or a 404 if the car was not found
11. Add additional functionality to GET "/cars" endpoint so that I can filter cars by color. For example GET
    "/cars?color=red" should return all the cars which are red
